Cancellable animation component with gsap timeline.

[vue-timeline-component.now.sh](https://vue-timeline-component.now.sh/)

This demo is based on my old css prototype [https://codepen.io/karlito40/pen/RPmWKe](https://codepen.io/karlito40/pen/RPmWKe) but it was not flexible at all. 

Now it can scale any dom element without the need to position them properly.
